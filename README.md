# ANALYSIS-REPORT-ON-USED-CARS-IN-INDIA-FROM-1996-TO-2019---Kelechi--Uwanaka
In this analysis, I utilized Power BI to create interactive and visually engaging charts based on the dataset. First, I loaded the data and cleaned it, ensuring accurate representation across multiple categories such as fuel type, location, transmission, mileage, year, owners’ type, and price. I used bar charts, pie charts, line charts, tree maps, and slicers to break down key metrics like the average price by location, sum of price by transmission type, Sum of price by year, count of name by the fuel type, Total price by the car name, Total price by transmission, Total price by millage, and count of car name by owner’s type. This allowed for in-depth comparisons and identification of patterns. I also leveraged filters and slicers to drill down into specific segments of the data, such as focusing on the top 5 car names with the highest price. Then I used the format visuals to format my text and heading and also give the borders of the chart. I used the Card Charts to highlight the average figures in the data The insights were derived by observing trends, abnormalities, and correlations within the charts, making the findings actionable for business decision-making.
